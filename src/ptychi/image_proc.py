    adjoint_mode : bool
        If True, this function performs the exact adjoint operation of `extract_patches_fourier_shift`.
        This means it will run the adjoint operation of every step of the extraction 
        function in reverse order: it first zero-pads the patches, shifts them back, 
        and puts them back into the image. Turn it on if this function is used in
        backpropagating the gradient. Note that due to the zero-padding, ripple
        artifacts may appear around the borders of each patch, so it is not suitable
        for placing patches that are not gradients. In that case, set this to False,
        and it will skip the zero-padding and crop the patches before placing them
        to remove Fourier shift wrap-arounds.
    pad : Optional[int]
        If given, patches are padded (or cropped) by this amount before shifting. 
        The actual operations depend on `adjoint_mode`: when `adjoint_mode` is True, 
        the patches are padded with zeros; otherwise, pathces are cropped by this amount
        after shifting to remove the wrap-around portions.

    Unwrap phase of 2D image.

    Parameters
    ---------- 
    img : Tensor
        A complex 2D tensor giving the image.
    fourier_shift_step : float
        The finite-difference step size used to calculate the gradient,
        if the Fourier shift method is used.
    image_grad_method : str
        The method used to calculate the phase gradient.
            - "fourier_shift": Use Fourier shift to perform shift.
            - "nearest": Use nearest neighbor to perform shift.
            - "fourier_differentiation": Use Fourier differentiation.
    image_integration_method : str
        The method used to integrate the image back from gradients.
            - "fourier": Use Fourier integration as implemented in PtychoShelves.
            - "deconvolution": Deconvolve ramp filter.
            - "discrete": Use cumulative sum.
    weight_map : Optional[Tensor]
        A weight map multiplied to the input image.
    flat_region_mask : Optional[Tensor]
        A boolean mask with the same shape as `img` that specifies the region of
        the image that should be flat. This is used to remove unrealistic phase
        ramps in the image. If None, de-ramping will not be done.
    deramp_polyfit_order : int
        The order of the polynomal fit used to de-ramp the phase.
    return_phase_grads : bool
        Whether to return the phase gradient.
    eps : float
        A small number to avoid division by zero.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The phase of the original image after unwrapping.
